#### replication
replication is process to sync data across multiple servers.
replication can increase the read/write ability, recover from failover.
but need additional space for storage.

replica set is group of mongod instances host the same data.
the primary always do the write operations. just one primary in each replica set.

## concept operation log.
the primary will record all update / write in operation log.
the secondary copy operation log then apply to its data copy.

## election of primary
if current primary is down, or at the begin of mongo start.
need decide which one is primary.
arbiter is component which not include any data but just involve the election.
so whole elector number can't be even, we always can get new leader.



#### Shard


#### Index
mongo db index is similar to other database, use B-tree.

#### write protocol.
it is based on tcp/ip and just include message head and data with bson format.

#### db file location and format.
the default path is /data/db.
for each db named like foo. then there is foo.ns, foo.1, foo.2 data files.
and foo.n+1 will be the double size of foo.n

mongo use pre-assign for file space. fill all empty part as zero.

foo.ns to store meta data like name space for collection, index.


#### file map to memory
mongo map all data file to memory. need huge virtual memory.
mongo can't control the order of write to disc.
