#### lock
mongo use read-write lock.
mongo just provide db level lock. traditional db provide record level lock.


#### transaction
document level.



#### problems
1. how to store tree type data structure is a challenge.
a lot of ways to create, depend on the frequencies of different ops.

2. create index brings lock and long-time wait
create index in background.

3. map reduce of mongo db is slow. it is ok for some background process.
