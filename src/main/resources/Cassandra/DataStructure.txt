#### Cassandra combine the key/value from Dynamo and Bigtable 's column storage.
we can take it as 4-5 dimension hash table.
1. column  three data tuple, name/value/timestamp.
2. super column. name and value, value includes several columns.
A super column is a special column, therefore, it is also a key-value pair.
But a super column stores a map of sub-columns.
3. column family. like table in RDBMS. two types standard and super.
4. keyspace.
