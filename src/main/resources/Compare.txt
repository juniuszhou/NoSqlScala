#### four types of NoSql db
1. document mongo, sequoiaDB (from china company)
2. memory Redis.
3. column HBase, cassandra, Dynamo (from Amazon)
4. graph. Neo4j




#### Mongo VS Cassandra
Mongo not good at write because of its global lock mechanism.




#### a paper to compare different db. http://msrg.utoronto.ca/papers/NoSQLBenchmark
or its chinese version in csdn http://www.csdn.net/article/2014-12-09/2823026

we can see mongo for read is the best.
